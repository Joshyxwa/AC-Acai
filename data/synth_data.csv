Global Public Chat Rooms,A feature that allows any user to join and participate in real-time, public text-based chat rooms on various topics.,"Relevant Law(s): 18 U.S.C. § 2258A. Why: The feature could be used to facilitate the online sexual exploitation of children (e.g., grooming, distribution of CSAM in chat). The provider may have a duty to report 'apparent violations' discovered in these chats to the CyberTipline. Compliance is not about the feature's design but the company's reporting and preservation procedures once harmful content is identified."
Anonymous Age Estimation Tool,An algorithm that estimates a user's age based on their browsing behavior and device type, without collecting government ID.,"Relevant Law(s): Utah Code § 13-63-102, Florida Statute § 501.1736. Why: Both laws require age verification for minors. Utah requires verification for all users, and Florida prohibits accounts for users under 14. This estimation tool, if used as the sole method, is likely NON-COMPLIANT. These laws typically require more robust 'age assurance' or 'verification' methods, often defined in rules (Utah) or requiring reasonable methods (Florida), which an estimation algorithm may not satisfy."
Parental Dashboard,A portal where a verified parent can see their teen's friend list, screen time usage, and privacy settings.,"Relevant Law(s): Utah Code § 13-63-104, California SB 976 § 27002. Why: Utah law explicitly requires providing a parent with access to view their minor's posts and messages. California law requires providing a mechanism for parents to set time limits and access controls. This feature appears COMPLIANT with both statutes as it provides the required access and control mechanisms."
Algorithmic "For You" Feed,A feed that recommends and prioritizes content for a user based on their past interactions, likes, and follows.,"Relevant Law(s): California SB 976. Why: This is the definition of an 'addictive feed' under the Act. It is UNLAWFUL to provide this feed to a user unless the operator has verified the user is not a minor or has obtained verifiable parental consent. Merely having the feature is not automatically non-compliant; non-compliance occurs if it is provided to a California minor without the required consent/verification."
Scheduled Posting,Allows users to write a post and schedule it to be published at a specific future date and time.,"Relevant Law(s): None. Why: This feature does not involve addictive algorithms, age verification, parental controls, or content that would trigger mandatory reporting for child exploitation. It is a neutral utility feature with no direct relevance to the provided laws."
Push Notification System,A system that sends alerts to a user's device about new likes, comments, or followed accounts going live.,"Relevant Law(s): California SB 976 § 27002, Florida Statute § 501.1736 (definition). Why: Both laws specifically regulate notifications sent to minors. California prohibits sending notifications to a minor during nighttime and school hours without verifiable parental consent. Florida includes 'push notifications' in its definition of an addictive feature for a 'social media platform'. The feature itself is not non-compliant, but its application to known minors without the required consents or outside permitted hours would be."
Live Streaming Monetization,Allows users to broadcast live video and receive virtual gifts or donations from viewers in real-time.,"Relevant Law(s): 18 U.S.C. § 2258A, Florida Statute § 501.1736 (definition). Why: Live streaming is explicitly listed as an addictive feature in the Florida law. More critically, live streams can be used for child sexual exploitation. The provider has a duty under federal law to report any facts or circumstances of an apparent violation discovered on a live stream. The feature must have robust content moderation and reporting systems to be compliant."
Default Public Profile for New Users,All new user accounts are set to 'public' by default, making their posts visible to anyone.,"Relevant Law(s): California SB 976 § 27002. Why: The California Act requires operators to set a minor's account to 'private mode' BY DEFAULT, where only connected users can view content. Having a public default for all users is likely NON-COMPLIANT for any accounts held by California minors, as it violates the default setting requirement."
E-Commerce Product Review Feed,A feed on a retail website showing product reviews and ratings left by other shoppers.,"Relevant Law(s): California SB 976 § 27000.5(b)(2)(A). Why: The California Act explicitly EXEMPTS online services where interactions are limited to consumer reviews of products. This feature would likely not be considered an 'addictive internet-based service or application' and is therefore not subject to the Act's restrictions. This feature is COMPLIANT due to a specific exemption."
In-App Digital Wallet,A feature that allows users to store payment information and currency to make in-app purchases.,"Relevant Law(s): 18 U.S.C. § 2258A. Why: While not directly regulating the wallet itself, the federal reporting law states that reports to the CyberTipline may include 'payment information' to help identify violators. The company must have a process to preserve and provide this data in the context of a report, but the feature itself does not violate the law."
"Top Liked" Content Aggregator,A section of the app that shows the most-liked posts from across the platform in the last 24 hours.,"Relevant Law(s): California SB 976, Florida Statute § 501.1736. Why: This feature displays 'personal interactive metrics' (like counts) and uses algorithmic selection (choosing top posts), which are characteristics of regulated platforms. If shown to minors, it could be part of an 'addictive feed' (CA) or utilize an 'addictive feature' (FL). Its compliance depends on whether it is shown to verified minors without the required parental consent (CA) or if the platform is subject to Florida's law based on its other features."
"Anonymous Polling","A feature allowing users to create and participate in polls where votes are completely anonymous and not linked to user profiles.","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 17 (Statement of Reasons). WHY: The feature itself is likely compliant as it is a neutral tool. However, if a poll is removed for being illegal (e.g., coordinating violence), the provider must still issue a statement of reasons to the user who created it, explaining the removal even if the voters are anonymous. The obligation to inform the content provider remains."
"AI Content Moderation - High Risk","An automated system that proactively scans all video uploads for potential terrorist content using machine learning. It automatically and immediately removes content flagged with a 95%+ confidence score.","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 7 (Voluntary own-initiative investigations), Article 8 (No general monitoring obligation), Article 17 (Statement of Reasons). WHY: The use of automated tools for proactive detection is permitted under Article 7 if done in good faith and diligently. However, the lack of human review before removal likely violates the requirement for a 'diligent' process and the obligation to provide a meaningful statement of reasons (Article 17) before or upon removal. This is a non-compliant implementation."
"Basic User Reporting","A simple button allowing users to report a post they believe violates the platform's rules. The report form requires selecting a category (e.g., spam, harassment) but does not require a detailed explanation.","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 16 (Notice and action mechanisms). WHY: The feature is a core compliance requirement. However, to be fully compliant, the mechanism must be designed to facilitate 'sufficiently precise and adequately substantiated' notices. A simple category drop-down may not be sufficient. The platform should encourage users to provide a free-text explanation to meet the standard of Article 16(2)."
"Transparent Ad Library","A searchable public database containing all ads running on the platform. For each ad, it shows the content, who paid for it, the targeting criteria used (e.g., 'aged 18-35, interested in sports'), and the approximate number of views.","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 26 (Advertising on online platforms), Article 39 (Additional online advertising transparency - for VLOPs). WHY: This feature is highly compliant and would fulfill the obligations of Article 26 for all online platforms. If the platform is a VLOP, this also satisfies the stricter repository requirements under Article 39, including the duration of one year after the ad last ran."
"Default Behavioral Ad Targeting","The platform's main ad system uses profiling based on user's in-app activity and inferred interests (from Article 9 of GDPR) to present targeted ads. This is the default and only option for advertisers. Users can opt-out.","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 26(3) (Prohibition on profiling using special category data), Article 28 (Online protection of minors). WHY: Using inferred interests that constitute 'special category data' (e.g., political opinions, health interests) for ads is prohibited under Article 26(3). Furthermore, if the platform is aware a user is a minor, this profiling is also prohibited under Article 28(2). This feature is non-compliant. A compliant system must not use these data categories for ad targeting."
"Public API for Researchers","An interface that allows academic researchers to access, for analysis, a real-time feed of publicly available data such as post IDs, timestamps, and aggregate engagement metrics (e.g., number of likes per public page).","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 40 (Data access and scrutiny - for VLOPs). WHY: For a standard online platform, this feature has no direct legal obligation but is a best practice. For a VLOP, Article 40(12) requires providing access to publicly accessible data to vetted researchers. This feature would be a compliant method for fulfilling that specific obligation for the subset of data that is public."
"Dark Pattern Sign-Up","During account creation, the 'Accept All' button for data processing is large, bright, and prominent. The 'Customize Settings' option is a faint, grey text link. The pre-selected choices maximize data collection for advertising.","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 25 (Online interface design). WHY: This design 'materially distorts or impairs the ability of the recipients of their service to make free and informed decisions' by making the privacy-friendly choice deliberately difficult to find and select. This is a prohibited dark pattern under Article 25 and is non-compliant."
"Two-Tiered Complaint System","An internal complaint-handling system that is easily accessible and allows users to appeal content moderation decisions. All appeals are reviewed by a human agent within 48 hours.","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 20 (Internal complaint-handling system). WHY: This feature is directly mandated by Article 20 for all online platforms. The described system, with easy access, human review, and a timely process, appears compliant. It fulfills the requirement to provide recipients with an effective mechanism to contest decisions."
"Geo-Blocked Content Removal","A feature allowing national law enforcement to request the removal of specific content. The platform's system can restrict the removal so the content is only inaccessible in the requesting country's territory.","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 9 (Orders to act against illegal content). WHY: This feature is compliant and aligns with the principle of territoriality in Article 9(2)(b). The DSA requires that the territorial scope of removal orders 'is limited to what is strictly necessary'. A geoblocking capability allows the platform to comply with a national order without imposing a disproportionate global restriction."
"Simplified Terms of Service","A feature that presents users with a short, animated video summarizing the key points of the platform's Terms of Service, including what content is not allowed and how reporting works.","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 14 (Terms and conditions). WHY: This feature is compliant and aligns with the spirit of the regulation. Article 14 requires terms to be in 'clear, plain, intelligible, user-friendly and unambiguous language'. Using a video summary for minors or all users is an excellent way to meet this obligation and improve transparency."
"Emoji Reaction Feature","Introduce a simple emoji reaction feature on posts, no content filtering involved.","RELEVANT LAWS: N/A. WHY: This feature does not involve the collection of minors’ data, targeted advertising, or access to restricted content. It is a neutral functionality with no relevant laws, making it compliant."
Curfew login blocker with ASL and GH for Utah minors,To comply with the Utah Social Media Regulation Act, we are implementing a curfew-based login restriction for users under 18. The system uses ASL to detect minor accounts and routes enforcement through GH to apply only within Utah boundaries. The feature activates during restricted night hours and logs activity using EchoTrace for auditability. This allows parental control to be enacted without user-facing alerts, operating in ShadowMode during initial rollout.,"Relevant Article: Utah Code § 13-63-105. Compliant (Y). Why: The feature directly implements the state-mandated access prohibition between 10:30 PM and 6:30 AM for minor accounts. It uses age signals (ASL) and geo-fencing (GH) for accurate enforcement within Utah, which is required. Audit logging (EchoTrace) supports compliance verification. | Yes. DSA Art. 28(1) requires ""appropriate and proportionate measures to ensure a high level of privacy, safety, and security of minors."""
PF default toggle with NR enforcement for California teens,As part of compliance with California’s SB976, the app will disable PF by default for users under 18 located in California. This default setting is considered NR to override, unless explicit parental opt-in is provided. Geo-detection is handled via GH, and rollout is monitored with FR logs. The design ensures minimal disruption while meeting the strict personalization requirements imposed by the law.,"Relevant Article: CA Health & Safety Code § 27001 (SB976). Compliant (Y). Why: The feature's core function is to disable the addictive feed (PF) by default for minors, which is the primary requirement of the law. It requires verifiable parental consent (NR override) to enable it, which is compliant. Geo-enforcement (GH) ensures it only applies in California. | Yes. DSA Art. 28(1) requires measures to protect minors, including default safety settings."
Child abuse content scanner using T5 and CDS triggers,In line with the US federal law requiring providers to report child sexual abuse content to NCMEC, this feature scans uploads and flags suspected materials tagged as T5. Once flagged, the CDS auto-generates reports and routes them via secure channel APIs. The logic runs in real-time, supports human validation, and logs detection metadata for internal audits. Regional thresholds are governed by LCP parameters in the backend.,"Relevant Article: 18 U.S. Code § 2258A. Compliant (Y). Why: The feature directly fulfills the federal mandate to report apparent child sexual abuse material (T5) to NCMEC. The automated reporting via CDS and secure channels aligns with the requirement to report ""as soon as reasonably possible."" Audit logging (EchoTrace) is a best practice for compliance evidence. | Yes. DSA Art. 18 requires providers to inform law enforcement of criminal offences involving threats to life or safety, including child abuse."
Content visibility lock with NSP for EU DSA,To meet the transparency expectations of the EU Digital Services Act, we are introducing a visibility lock for flagged user-generated content labeled under NSP. When such content is detected, a soft Softblock is applied and GH ensures enforcement is restricted to the EU region only. EchoTrace supports traceability, and Redline status can be triggered for legal review. This feature enhances accountability and complies with Article 16’s removal mechanisms.,"Relevant Article: EU DSA (Not in provided docs, but described in feature). Compliant (Y). Why: While the EU DSA is not in the provided US state laws, the feature's described mechanism (soft block, geo-enforcement via GH, audit tracing with EchoTrace, legal review triggers) demonstrates a structure designed for accountability and region-specific compliance, which aligns with the stated goal of meeting the DSA. | Yes. Directly implements DSA Arts. 16 (notice & action) and 17 (statement of reasons)."
Jellybean-based parental notifications for Florida regulation,To support Florida's Online Protections for Minors law, this feature extends the Jellybean parental control framework. Notifications are dispatched to verified parent accounts when a minor attempts to access restricted features. Using IMT, the system checks behavioral anomalies against BB models. If violations are detected, restrictions are applied in ShadowMode with full audit logging through CDS. Glow flags ensure compliance visibility during rollout phases.,"Relevant Article: FL Statute § 501.1736. Partially Compliant (N). Why: The Florida law focuses on age verification and account termination for users under 14 and 14-15 without parental consent, not on parental notifications for feature access. This feature, while potentially beneficial, does not directly address the core legal requirements of FL § 501.1736, which are prohibitions on account creation and mandates for termination. | Yes. DSA Art. 28(1) encourages tools for parental control and minor safety."
Unified retention control via DRT & CDS,Introduce a data retention feature using DRT thresholds, ensuring automatic log deletion across all regions. CDS will continuously audit retention violations, triggering EchoTrace as necessary. Spanner logic ensures all platform modules comply uniformly.,"Relevant Article: 18 U.S. Code § 2258A(h). Compliant (Y). Why: The federal law requires providers to preserve contents of a CyberTipline report for 90 days. A unified DRT system that enforces consistent retention policies and audits for violations (CDS) would ensure compliance with this and other data retention laws, preventing premature deletion of legally required data. | Yes. DSA Art. 13(5) requires storage of trader info; general data governance aligns with DSA principles."
T5 tagging for sensitive reports,When users report content containing high-risk information, it is tagged as T5 for internal routing. CDS then enforces escalation. The system is universal and does not rely on regional toggles or GH routes.,"Relevant Article: 18 U.S. Code § 2258A. Compliant (Y). Why: The federal law requires reporting upon obtaining knowledge of facts or circumstances described in the statute. A system that tags and escalates user reports of such content (T5) is a compliant method for gathering that knowledge and initiating the reporting process, even without geo-restrictions. | Yes. DSA Art. 16 requires mechanisms for users to notify illegal content."
Underage protection via Snowcap trigger,Snowcap is activated for all underage users platform-wide, applying ASL to segment accounts. Actions taken under this logic are routed to CDS and monitored using BB to identify deviations in usage.,"Relevant Article: UT Code § 13-63-102, CA HSC § 27001, FL Statute § 501.1736. Compliant (Y). Why: All three state laws require identifying and taking action regarding underage users. A platform-wide system (Snowcap) that uses age signals (ASL) to segment and protect minor accounts is a foundational, compliant step towards meeting the various age assurance and consent requirements across jurisdictions. | Yes. DSA Art. 28(1) requires measures to protect minors."
Age-specific notification controls with ASL,Notifications will be tailored by age using ASL, allowing us to throttle or suppress push alerts for minors. EchoTrace will log adjustments, and CDS will verify enforcement across rollout waves.,"Relevant Article: CA Health & Safety Code § 27002 (SB976). Compliant (Y). Why: SB976 specifically restricts sending notifications to minors during school hours (8am-3pm) and overnight (12am-6am) without parental consent. A system that uses age signals (ASL) to suppress notifications is directly compliant with this requirement. | Yes. DSA Art. 28(1) requires measures to protect minors, including notification controls."
Flag escalation flow for sensitive comments,A flow that detects high-risk comment content and routes it via CDS with Redline markers. The logic applies generally and is monitored through EchoTrace, with no mention of regional policies.,"Relevant Article: 18 U.S. Code § 2258A. Compliant (Y). Why: This feature supports compliance with the federal mandate. By detecting and escalating high-risk content (which could include facts or circumstances described in the law), it helps the platform obtain the ""actual knowledge"" that triggers the duty to report to NCMEC. | Yes. DSA Arts. 16–18 require mechanisms to detect and act on illegal content."
Minor-safe chat expansion via Jellybean,We’re expanding chat features, but for users flagged by Jellybean, certain functions (e.g., media sharing) will be limited. BB and ASL will monitor compliance posture.,"Relevant Article: UT Code § 13-63-103(1). Compliant (Y). Why: The Utah law requires social media companies to ""prohibit direct messaging between the account and any other user that is not linked to the account through friending"" for minor accounts. Using a parental control framework (Jellybean) to enforce limitations on new chat features for minors aligns with this requirement to restrict open communication. | Yes. DSA Art. 28(1) requires measures to protect minors, including in communication features."
Friend suggestions with underage safeguards,New suggestion logic uses PF to recommend friends, but minors are excluded from adult pools using ASL and CDS logic. EchoTrace logs interactions in case future policy gates are needed.,"Relevant Article: UT Code § 13-63-103(5). Compliant (Y). Why: The Utah law prohibits social media companies from ""target[ing] or suggest[ing]... accounts"" for minor accounts. This feature explicitly uses age signals (ASL) to prevent minors from being suggested to adults (and vice versa), which is compliant. | Yes. DSA Art. 28(1) requires protecting minors from unwanted contact."
Reaction GIFs with embedded filtering,Enable GIFs in comments, while filtering content deemed inappropriate for minor accounts. Softblock will apply if a flagged GIF is used by ASL-flagged profiles.,"Relevant Article: General Duty of Care. Compliant (Y). Why: While not explicitly stated in a single article, all laws imply a general duty to protect minors from harmful content. Proactively filtering content and applying restrictions for minor accounts (via ASL) demonstrates a compliant approach to this duty. | Yes. DSA Art. 28(1) requires measures to protect minors from harmful content."
Longform posts with age-based moderation,Longform post creation is now open to all. However, moderation for underage authors is stricter via Snowcap.,"Relevant Article: General Duty of Care. Compliant (Y). Why: Applying stricter content moderation policies to content created by minors is a prudent and likely compliant measure that aligns with the overall protective intent of all the attached legislation. | Yes. DSA Art. 28(1) requires heightened protection for minors."
Custom avatar system with identity checks,Users can now design custom avatars. For safety, T5 triggers block adult-themed assets from use by underage profiles. Age detection uses ASL and logs flow through GH.,"Relevant Article: General Duty of Care. Compliant (Y). Why: This feature uses age assurance (ASL) to restrict minors' access to age-inappropriate material (adult-themed assets). This proactive protection aligns with the goals of the Utah, California, and Florida laws to create safer online environments for minors. | Yes. DSA Art. 28(1) requires measures to protect minors from inappropriate content."
Age-gated duet & stitch for COPPA compliance,"To align with COPPA requirements, users under 16 will have the Duet and Stitch features disabled by default. An ASL flag determines age, and GH enforces the restriction geographically. Parental controls within the Jellybean framework can override this setting, with all changes logged to EchoTrace for auditability.","Relevant to Florida HB 3 (Section 501.1736) and Utah S.B. 152 (Section 13-63-102) due to age verification and parental consent requirements for minors under 14 and 16. Also relevant to DSA Article 28 (Online protection of minors) and Article 35 (Mitigation of risks) for protecting minors and implementing proportionate measures."
Dark pattern prevention for EU DSA & CMA,"This feature introduces UI guardrails to prevent manipulative design patterns (e.g., confusing opt-outs, forced nudges) for users in the EU and UK. GH manages regional application, LCP parameters define specific patterns, and CDS audits all UI changes for compliance. Redline status is triggered for any potential violation.","Relevant to DSA Article 25 (Online interface design and organisation) which prohibits deceptive or manipulative design that impairs free and informed decisions."
California Age-Appropriate Design Code (AADC) privacy dashboard,"For users under 18 in California, a new privacy dashboard provides clear data usage explanations and simplified settings. ASL identifies eligible accounts, GH confines the feature to CA, and Spanner handles the data mapping. All access and changes are logged to FR for regulatory reporting.","Relevant to California SB 976 (Protecting Our Kids from Social Media Addiction Act) which requires age-appropriate design and parental controls for minors. Also relevant to DSA Article 28 (Online protection of minors) and Article 14 (Terms and conditions) for transparency and minor safety."
Real-time hate speech classifier with regional LCP,"A new ML model flags hate speech in comments and video captions in real-time. The sensitivity thresholds are governed by LCP parameters that vary by region, as defined by GH. Flagged content is routed to CDS for human review and potential Softblock, with EchoTrace providing an audit trail.","Relevant to DSA Article 16 (Notice and action mechanisms), Article 34 (Risk assessment), and Article 35 (Mitigation of risks) for detecting and addressing illegal content and systemic risks."
Targeted ad category blocker for teens,"To comply with various state regulations, this feature uses ASL to restrict ad targeting categories (e.g., weight loss, financial products) for minor accounts. The NR setting is applied by default and can only be modified by parental controls. CDS monitors ad deliveries for violations.","Relevant to Utah S.B. 152 (Section 13-63-103) which prohibits targeted advertising to minor accounts. Also relevant to DSA Article 26 (Advertising on online platforms) and Article 28 (Online protection of minors) for ad transparency and minor protection."
Right-to-erasure automated workflow,"Implements a one-click process for GDPR and CCPA deletion requests. Upon initiation, DRT rules trigger the automated purging of user data across all systems. CDS generates a verification report and EchoTrace logs the entire process from request to completion for legal defensibility.","Relevant to DSA Article 17 (Statement of reasons) and general data protection principles under the DSA, which align with GDPR and CCPA requirements."
Live stream moderator assist with T5 escalation,"Provides live streamers with real-time alerts for potentially violating comments. Comments tagged as T5 are auto-hidden and escalated for priority review. The system uses BB models to improve detection accuracy and is available globally without GH dependency.","Relevant to DSA Article 16 (Notice and action mechanisms) and Article 35 (Mitigation of risks) for content moderation and risk mitigation."
"For You" page freshness algorithm,"A new PF variant designed to surface older, ""evergreen"" content alongside trending videos to improve content diversity. BB models are used to identify qualifying content, and the experiment is rolled out using Spanner to isolate test cohorts.","Relevant to DSA Article 27 (Recommender system transparency) and Article 34 (Risk assessment) for algorithmic transparency and mitigating risks related to content amplification."
