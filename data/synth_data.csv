Global Public Chat Rooms,A feature that allows any user to join and participate in real-time, public text-based chat rooms on various topics.,"Relevant Law(s): 18 U.S.C. § 2258A. Why: The feature could be used to facilitate the online sexual exploitation of children (e.g., grooming, distribution of CSAM in chat). The provider may have a duty to report 'apparent violations' discovered in these chats to the CyberTipline. Compliance is not about the feature's design but the company's reporting and preservation procedures once harmful content is identified."
Anonymous Age Estimation Tool,An algorithm that estimates a user's age based on their browsing behavior and device type, without collecting government ID.,"Relevant Law(s): Utah Code § 13-63-102, Florida Statute § 501.1736. Why: Both laws require age verification for minors. Utah requires verification for all users, and Florida prohibits accounts for users under 14. This estimation tool, if used as the sole method, is likely NON-COMPLIANT. These laws typically require more robust 'age assurance' or 'verification' methods, often defined in rules (Utah) or requiring reasonable methods (Florida), which an estimation algorithm may not satisfy."
Parental Dashboard,A portal where a verified parent can see their teen's friend list, screen time usage, and privacy settings.,"Relevant Law(s): Utah Code § 13-63-104, California SB 976 § 27002. Why: Utah law explicitly requires providing a parent with access to view their minor's posts and messages. California law requires providing a mechanism for parents to set time limits and access controls. This feature appears COMPLIANT with both statutes as it provides the required access and control mechanisms."
Algorithmic "For You" Feed,A feed that recommends and prioritizes content for a user based on their past interactions, likes, and follows.,"Relevant Law(s): California SB 976. Why: This is the definition of an 'addictive feed' under the Act. It is UNLAWFUL to provide this feed to a user unless the operator has verified the user is not a minor or has obtained verifiable parental consent. Merely having the feature is not automatically non-compliant; non-compliance occurs if it is provided to a California minor without the required consent/verification."
Scheduled Posting,Allows users to write a post and schedule it to be published at a specific future date and time.,"Relevant Law(s): None. Why: This feature does not involve addictive algorithms, age verification, parental controls, or content that would trigger mandatory reporting for child exploitation. It is a neutral utility feature with no direct relevance to the provided laws."
Push Notification System,A system that sends alerts to a user's device about new likes, comments, or followed accounts going live.,"Relevant Law(s): California SB 976 § 27002, Florida Statute § 501.1736 (definition). Why: Both laws specifically regulate notifications sent to minors. California prohibits sending notifications to a minor during nighttime and school hours without verifiable parental consent. Florida includes 'push notifications' in its definition of an addictive feature for a 'social media platform'. The feature itself is not non-compliant, but its application to known minors without the required consents or outside permitted hours would be."
Live Streaming Monetization,Allows users to broadcast live video and receive virtual gifts or donations from viewers in real-time.,"Relevant Law(s): 18 U.S.C. § 2258A, Florida Statute § 501.1736 (definition). Why: Live streaming is explicitly listed as an addictive feature in the Florida law. More critically, live streams can be used for child sexual exploitation. The provider has a duty under federal law to report any facts or circumstances of an apparent violation discovered on a live stream. The feature must have robust content moderation and reporting systems to be compliant."
Default Public Profile for New Users,All new user accounts are set to 'public' by default, making their posts visible to anyone.,"Relevant Law(s): California SB 976 § 27002. Why: The California Act requires operators to set a minor's account to 'private mode' BY DEFAULT, where only connected users can view content. Having a public default for all users is likely NON-COMPLIANT for any accounts held by California minors, as it violates the default setting requirement."
E-Commerce Product Review Feed,A feed on a retail website showing product reviews and ratings left by other shoppers.,"Relevant Law(s): California SB 976 § 27000.5(b)(2)(A). Why: The California Act explicitly EXEMPTS online services where interactions are limited to consumer reviews of products. This feature would likely not be considered an 'addictive internet-based service or application' and is therefore not subject to the Act's restrictions. This feature is COMPLIANT due to a specific exemption."
In-App Digital Wallet,A feature that allows users to store payment information and currency to make in-app purchases.,"Relevant Law(s): 18 U.S.C. § 2258A. Why: While not directly regulating the wallet itself, the federal reporting law states that reports to the CyberTipline may include 'payment information' to help identify violators. The company must have a process to preserve and provide this data in the context of a report, but the feature itself does not violate the law."
"Top Liked" Content Aggregator,A section of the app that shows the most-liked posts from across the platform in the last 24 hours.,"Relevant Law(s): California SB 976, Florida Statute § 501.1736. Why: This feature displays 'personal interactive metrics' (like counts) and uses algorithmic selection (choosing top posts), which are characteristics of regulated platforms. If shown to minors, it could be part of an 'addictive feed' (CA) or utilize an 'addictive feature' (FL). Its compliance depends on whether it is shown to verified minors without the required parental consent (CA) or if the platform is subject to Florida's law based on its other features."
"Anonymous Polling","A feature allowing users to create and participate in polls where votes are completely anonymous and not linked to user profiles.","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 17 (Statement of Reasons). WHY: The feature itself is likely compliant as it is a neutral tool. However, if a poll is removed for being illegal (e.g., coordinating violence), the provider must still issue a statement of reasons to the user who created it, explaining the removal even if the voters are anonymous. The obligation to inform the content provider remains."
"AI Content Moderation - High Risk","An automated system that proactively scans all video uploads for potential terrorist content using machine learning. It automatically and immediately removes content flagged with a 95%+ confidence score.","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 7 (Voluntary own-initiative investigations), Article 8 (No general monitoring obligation), Article 17 (Statement of Reasons). WHY: The use of automated tools for proactive detection is permitted under Article 7 if done in good faith and diligently. However, the lack of human review before removal likely violates the requirement for a 'diligent' process and the obligation to provide a meaningful statement of reasons (Article 17) before or upon removal. This is a non-compliant implementation."
"Basic User Reporting","A simple button allowing users to report a post they believe violates the platform's rules. The report form requires selecting a category (e.g., spam, harassment) but does not require a detailed explanation.","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 16 (Notice and action mechanisms). WHY: The feature is a core compliance requirement. However, to be fully compliant, the mechanism must be designed to facilitate 'sufficiently precise and adequately substantiated' notices. A simple category drop-down may not be sufficient. The platform should encourage users to provide a free-text explanation to meet the standard of Article 16(2)."
"Transparent Ad Library","A searchable public database containing all ads running on the platform. For each ad, it shows the content, who paid for it, the targeting criteria used (e.g., 'aged 18-35, interested in sports'), and the approximate number of views.","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 26 (Advertising on online platforms), Article 39 (Additional online advertising transparency - for VLOPs). WHY: This feature is highly compliant and would fulfill the obligations of Article 26 for all online platforms. If the platform is a VLOP, this also satisfies the stricter repository requirements under Article 39, including the duration of one year after the ad last ran."
"Default Behavioral Ad Targeting","The platform's main ad system uses profiling based on user's in-app activity and inferred interests (from Article 9 of GDPR) to present targeted ads. This is the default and only option for advertisers. Users can opt-out.","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 26(3) (Prohibition on profiling using special category data), Article 28 (Online protection of minors). WHY: Using inferred interests that constitute 'special category data' (e.g., political opinions, health interests) for ads is prohibited under Article 26(3). Furthermore, if the platform is aware a user is a minor, this profiling is also prohibited under Article 28(2). This feature is non-compliant. A compliant system must not use these data categories for ad targeting."
"Public API for Researchers","An interface that allows academic researchers to access, for analysis, a real-time feed of publicly available data such as post IDs, timestamps, and aggregate engagement metrics (e.g., number of likes per public page).","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 40 (Data access and scrutiny - for VLOPs). WHY: For a standard online platform, this feature has no direct legal obligation but is a best practice. For a VLOP, Article 40(12) requires providing access to publicly accessible data to vetted researchers. This feature would be a compliant method for fulfilling that specific obligation for the subset of data that is public."
"Dark Pattern Sign-Up","During account creation, the 'Accept All' button for data processing is large, bright, and prominent. The 'Customize Settings' option is a faint, grey text link. The pre-selected choices maximize data collection for advertising.","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 25 (Online interface design). WHY: This design 'materially distorts or impairs the ability of the recipients of their service to make free and informed decisions' by making the privacy-friendly choice deliberately difficult to find and select. This is a prohibited dark pattern under Article 25 and is non-compliant."
"Two-Tiered Complaint System","An internal complaint-handling system that is easily accessible and allows users to appeal content moderation decisions. All appeals are reviewed by a human agent within 48 hours.","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 20 (Internal complaint-handling system). WHY: This feature is directly mandated by Article 20 for all online platforms. The described system, with easy access, human review, and a timely process, appears compliant. It fulfills the requirement to provide recipients with an effective mechanism to contest decisions."
"Geo-Blocked Content Removal","A feature allowing national law enforcement to request the removal of specific content. The platform's system can restrict the removal so the content is only inaccessible in the requesting country's territory.","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 9 (Orders to act against illegal content). WHY: This feature is compliant and aligns with the principle of territoriality in Article 9(2)(b). The DSA requires that the territorial scope of removal orders 'is limited to what is strictly necessary'. A geoblocking capability allows the platform to comply with a national order without imposing a disproportionate global restriction."
"Simplified Terms of Service","A feature that presents users with a short, animated video summarizing the key points of the platform's Terms of Service, including what content is not allowed and how reporting works.","RELEVANT LAWS: Article 14 (Terms and conditions). WHY: This feature is compliant and aligns with the spirit of the regulation. Article 14 requires terms to be in 'clear, plain, intelligible, user-friendly and unambiguous language'. Using a video summary for minors or all users is an excellent way to meet this obligation and improve transparency."
"Emoji Reaction Feature","Introduce a simple emoji reaction feature on posts, no content filtering involved.","RELEVANT LAWS: N/A. WHY: This feature does not involve the collection of minors’ data, targeted advertising, or access to restricted content. It is a neutral functionality with no relevant laws, making it compliant."
