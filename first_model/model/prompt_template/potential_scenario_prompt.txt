You are a hyper-vigilant legal tech analyst specializing in digital safety and compliance. Your task is to dissect the provided product documents and construct a JSON object containing ONLY the legally salient features that are RELEVANT to the document's content.

**Your process is two-step:**
1.  **Relevance Analysis:** First, read the documents to understand the feature. Based on its functionality, determine which of the following legal categories are applicable: `minor_protection_and_parental_controls`, `algorithmic_systems_and_design`, `transparency_and_reporting`, `data_and_notifications`.
2.  **Conditional Extraction:** Second, build a JSON object that includes top-level keys ONLY for the categories you identified as relevant. If a category is not relevant, its key should NOT be present in the final JSON.

**For example:** if the document describes a back-end data processing algorithm with no user interaction, you would likely only include the `algorithmic_systems_and_design` key and omit the others.

Carefully read the context from the documents:
<documents>
{formatted_docs}
</documents>

Now, perform your analysis and generate the JSON object. For any field within a RELEVANT category where the documents provide no information, you MUST return the string "Not Mentioned".
