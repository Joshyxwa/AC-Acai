        "reasoning": "The feature allows established creators to directly message minors without any age verification or parental consent mechanisms. The API endpoint for mentorship requests contains no age checks, and the TDD confirms messages go through standard DM service without special protections for minors. This directly violates Florida and Utah laws requiring parental consent for minors aged 14-15 to use social features.",
        "clarification_question": "The current design allows verified creators to message users who may be minors without any age verification or parental consent flow. Given the legal requirements in Florida and Utah for parental consent for users 14-17, how will Creator Connect verify user age and obtain parental consent before allowing mentorship connections with minors?"

        "reasoning": "The mentor eligibility criteria only checks for verified status OR 500k followers with 1-year account age. There are no safeguards against purchased or compromised accounts that meet these criteria. The service only validates against existing rules without any additional trust signals or recent activity verification to detect dormant accounts that may have been sold.",
        "clarification_question": "Since bad actors can purchase dormant verified accounts that meet the mentor criteria, are there plans to implement additional trust signals like recent activity patterns, sudden behavioral changes, or account authenticity checks before granting access to the Creator Connect feature?"

        "reasoning": "While the PRD states 'all interactions must be subject to enhanced monitoring' as a critical safety requirement, the TDD only implements standard DM filters and retroactive CDS logging. There is no proactive enhanced monitoring, real-time risk detection, or special handling for conversations involving minors as promised in the requirements.",
        "clarification_question": "The PRD identifies enhanced monitoring as critical for safety, but the implementation only uses standard message filters. What specific enhanced monitoring capabilities will be implemented to proactively detect grooming patterns or attempts to move conversations off-platform, especially when minors are involved?"

        "reasoning": "The threat scenario specifically involves bad actors moving conversations to unmonitored third-party platforms. While messages go through profanity filters, there's no mention of detecting patterns like sharing external usernames, Discord/Telegram handles, or other attempts to migrate conversations off-platform where grooming can occur undetected.",
        "clarification_question": "Given that predators often try to move conversations to unmonitored platforms, will Creator Connect implement detection for attempts to share external platform usernames or links, and what actions will be taken when such attempts are detected?"
