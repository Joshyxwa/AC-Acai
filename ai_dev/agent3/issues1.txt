Legal Violations Analysis
Based on the provided legal texts, the scenario above creates the following violations:

Florida State Law - Online Protection for Minors
Verdict: Clear Violation

Reasoning: The law states that for minors aged 14â€“15, accounts are allowed "only with parental/guardian consent." The scenario involves a 14-year-old user in Florida who holds an account and is able to accept a connection request without any parental consent mechanism being triggered. This is a direct breach. The platform would be liable for civil penalties of up to $50,000 per violation and the minor could sue for damages.

Utah Law - SB 152 & HB 311
Verdict: Clear Violation (on multiple counts)

Reasoning: Utah's SB 152 is extremely strict. The scenario violates the following provisions for minors under 18:

"Minors (<18) require parental consent to open or maintain an account." The 14-year-old user in the scenario does not have this.

"No direct messaging with unapproved accounts." The feature explicitly allows an unapproved adult account to initiate a DM conversation with a minor.
Furthermore, under HB 311, the feature could be considered an "addictive design" that causes harm, as it creates a social pressure for minors to connect with strangers to achieve success, leading to a foreseeable risk of mental and emotional harm.

NCMEC - Duty to Report
Verdict: Potential Violation (Failure to Report)

Reasoning: The final step of the scenario involves the creation of CSAM. If this activity were ever detected by the platform (e.g., through another user's report), the company would gain "actual knowledge" of the material. At that point, under federal law, they have a mandatory "Duty to Report" to NCMEC's CyberTipline. Any failure to do so would result in fines of up to $850,000 for a large provider. The scenario creates a high risk of this violation occurring.

EU Digital Services Act (DSA)
Verdict: Potential Violation (Failure of Risk Assessment)

Reasoning: The provided DSA text focuses on transparency and misinformation. However, it also requires platforms to conduct "Risk assessments on algorithms." A core principle of the full DSA is mitigating systemic risks, especially to minors. The "Creator Connect" feature, as designed, presents a foreseeable systemic risk of child endangerment. A proper risk assessment, as mandated by the DSA, would have identified this exact grooming scenario as a primary threat. Launching the feature without adequate safeguards (like age verification and parental consent) would therefore constitute a failure to properly assess and mitigate systemic risk.

California State Law - Protecting our Kids from Social Media Addiction
Verdict: Not Directly Applicable

Reasoning: The provided text for this law focuses specifically on "addictive feeds" (algorithmic, personalized content feeds) and "notification restrictions." The "Creator Connect" feature, while risky, is a direct messaging and connection tool, not an addictive feed in the way the statute defines it. Therefore, based on the provided text, this specific scenario does not directly violate this law.
