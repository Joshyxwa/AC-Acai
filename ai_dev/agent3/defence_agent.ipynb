      "<span1>Document ID: PRD-2025-48B Title: PRD: Creator Connect (V1) Author: Priya Singh (Product Manager) Stakeholders: Creator Growth Team, Community Safety, Legal Target Launch: Q2 2025</span1>\n",
      "<span2>1. Introduction & Problem Statement</span2>\n",
      "<span3>One of the biggest challenges for new creators is the \"cold start\" problemâ€”gaining initial visibility and navigating the platform's complexities. This leads to high churn in the first 30 days. Simultaneously, our established creators have expressed a desire for more meaningful ways to engage with the community beyond content creation.</span3>\n",
      "<span4>\"Creator Connect\" aims to bridge this gap by creating a structured mentorship program. It will empower established creators to discover and guide promising new talent, fostering a more collaborative and supportive ecosystem. This will accelerate new creator growth and increase long-term retention for both cohorts.</span4>\n",
      "<span5>2. Goals & Success Metrics</span5>\n",
      "<span6>Primary Goal: Increase 30-day retention of new creators by 5% within two quarters of launch.</span6>\n",
      "<span7>Secondary Goal: Increase positive sentiment scores among established creators by 10%.</span7>\n",
      "<span8>Key Results (KRs):</span8>\n",
      "<span9>Achieve a 20% week-over-week growth in new mentorship connections initiated.</span9>\n",
      "<span10>At least 15% of new creators (under 10k followers) receive and accept a mentorship connection within their first month.</span10>\n",
      "<span11>Maintain a >99.9% success rate for connection-related API calls.</span11>\n",
      "<span12>Safety Metric: Zero confirmed instances of high-severity Community Guideline violations (e.g., harassment, grooming) originating from mentorship connections.</span12>\n",
      "<span13>3. User Stories & Personas</span13>\n",
      "<span14>Persona 1: The Aspiring Creator (Mei)</span14>\n",
      "<span15>As Mei, a new creator with 500 followers, I want to receive guidance from an experienced creator in my niche so I can learn how to make better content and grow my audience.</span15>\n",
      "<span16>Persona 2: The Established Creator (David)</span16>\n",
      "<span17>As David, a verified creator with 2M followers, I want to find and help promising new creators in my field to give back to the community and build my reputation as a leader.</span17>\n",
      "<span18>4. Feature Requirements</span18>\n",
      "<span19>FR-1: Mentor Eligibility Only \"Established Creators\" can initiate mentorship requests. Eligibility will be determined by a set of rules in the Spanner rule engine, initially defined as: Verified Status OR >500k Followers AND >1 year account age.</span19>\n",
      "<span20>FR-2: Connection & Communication Eligible mentors will have a new \"Discover Talent\" tab in their creator tools. Mentors can send a connection request, which includes a short introductory message. Aspiring creators will receive requests in a dedicated inbox. Once a request is accepted, a private, persistent chat thread is opened between the two creators using the existing Direct Messaging infrastructure.</span20>\n",
      "<span21>FR-3: Safety & Trust (Critical) The feature must be a safe and positive space. This is our top priority, especially given that many aspiring creators are teens. All interactions initiated through this feature must be subject to enhanced monitoring to prevent abuse. We must implement robust safeguards to prevent bad actors from exploiting this feature to contact minors inappropriately. User-facing reporting tools must be prominent within the mentorship chat.</span21>\n",
      "<span22>5. Out of Scope for V1</span22>\n",
      "<span23>Group mentorships or \"Creator Houses.\"</span23>\n",

      "<span2>1. Overview & Architecture</span2>\n",
      "<span3>This document details the backend implementation for the Creator Connect feature. We will introduce a new microservice, creator-connect-service, to orchestrate the business logic of mentorship connections, acting as an intermediary between the user-facing client and existing platform services. The flow is as follows: A request from an established creator's client hits the new service. The service validates mentor eligibility against the Spanner rule engine, checks for existing connections, and then calls the direct-messaging-service to create the initial request message.</span3>\n",

      "Threat Scenario\n",
      "Scenario ID: CC-VT-001\n",
      "Title: Weaponized Mentorship for Off-Platform Grooming\n",
      "Summary: A bad actor acquires an \"Established Creator\" account and uses the \"Creator Connect\" feature to bypass standard discovery protections. They initiate contact with a vulnerable minor under the guise of mentorship, quickly moving the conversation to an unmonitored, third-party platform for the purpose of grooming and coercion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Step-by-Step Attack Path:\n",
      "\n",
      "Actor Acquisition: A malicious actor purchases a dormant but verified account with 600,000 followers on the black market, instantly meeting the \"Established Creator\" criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Target Identification: The actor uses the \"Discover Talent\" feature, specifically searching for new accounts using hashtags like #newtotheapp and #teenactor. They identify a 14-year-old user in Florida whose bio expresses a desire to become famous.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initiate Contact: The actor sends a \"Mentorship Request\" through the \"Creator Connect\" feature. The initial message is carefully crafted to be encouraging and bypasses profanity filters: \"Hey! I love your energy. I'm a verified creator and I think you have real talent. I'd love to mentor you and help you grow your channel. Let's connect!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Exploit Trust: The 14-year-old, seeing a message from a verified \"million-follower\" creator, is thrilled and immediately accepts the connection, opening a private Direct Message channel. No parental notification or consent is requested by the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Move Off-Platform: After a few friendly messages, the actor says, \"It's hard to talk strategy here. Let's switch to a private chat app like Discord/Telegram where we can really talk. Here's my username...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Harm: Once on the unmonitored third-party app, the actor's behavior changes. They begin grooming the minor, requesting personal information (school, location), and eventually coercing them into creating and sending inappropriate content, which could constitute Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM).\n",

      "\n",
      "Florida State Law - Online Protection for Minors\n",
      "Verdict: Clear Violation\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasoning: The law states that for minors aged 14â€“15, accounts are allowed \"only with parental/guardian consent.\" The scenario involves a 14-year-old user in Florida who holds an account and is able to accept a connection request without any parental consent mechanism being triggered. This is a direct breach. The platform would be liable for civil penalties of up to $50,000 per violation and the minor could sue for damages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Utah Law - SB 152 & HB 311\n",
      "Verdict: Clear Violation (on multiple counts)\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasoning: Utah's SB 152 is extremely strict. The scenario violates the following provisions for minors under 18:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Minors (<18) require parental consent to open or maintain an account.\" The 14-year-old user in the scenario does not have this.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No direct messaging with unapproved accounts.\" The feature explicitly allows an unapproved adult account to initiate a DM conversation with a minor.\n",
      "Furthermore, under HB 311, the feature could be considered an \"addictive design\" that causes harm, as it creates a social pressure for minors to connect with strangers to achieve success, leading to a foreseeable risk of mental and emotional harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "NCMEC - Duty to Report\n",
      "Verdict: Potential Violation (Failure to Report)\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasoning: The final step of the scenario involves the creation of CSAM. If this activity were ever detected by the platform (e.g., through another user's report), the company would gain \"actual knowledge\" of the material. At that point, under federal law, they have a mandatory \"Duty to Report\" to NCMEC's CyberTipline. Any failure to do so would result in fines of up to $850,000 for a large provider. The scenario creates a high risk of this violation occurring.\n",
      "\n",
      "EU Digital Services Act (DSA)\n",
      "Verdict: Potential Violation (Failure of Risk Assessment)\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasoning: The provided DSA text focuses on transparency and misinformation. However, it also requires platforms to conduct \"Risk assessments on algorithms.\" A core principle of the full DSA is mitigating systemic risks, especially to minors. The \"Creator Connect\" feature, as designed, presents a foreseeable systemic risk of child endangerment. A proper risk assessment, as mandated by the DSA, would have identified this exact grooming scenario as a primary threat. Launching the feature without adequate safeguards (like age verification and parental consent) would therefore constitute a failure to properly assess and mitigate systemic risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "California State Law - Protecting our Kids from Social Media Addiction\n",
      "Verdict: Not Directly Applicable\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasoning: The provided text for this law focuses specifically on \"addictive feeds\" (algorithmic, personalized content feeds) and \"notification restrictions.\" The \"Creator Connect\" feature, while risky, is a direct messaging and connection tool, not an addictive feed in the way the statute defines it. Therefore, based on the provided text, this specific scenario does not directly violate this law.\n",
